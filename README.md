# CS50project
My first CS50 project
This is Alejandro, and I'm starting to learn coding as a way to become more knowledgable on the tech world. I eventually would like to do some coding for my own use, and to be able to use my tech skills as a bridge to offer my extensive leadership and management background to tech startups.
